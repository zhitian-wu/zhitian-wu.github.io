## My background

I am currently a 1st year Master Animal Sciences student in Wageningen University & Research. Before coming to the Netherlands, I studied in Huazhong Agricultural University, and completed a bioinformatics bachelor's degree. I like to use Unix tools, exploring bioinformtics algorithms, data visualization, genetics, history, etc. I recently realized how computers have changed our world.

I am a solitary person because I was influenced by my parents and don't enjoy social activities. On the contrary, I enjoyed asking questions about why things are in the way they are.

## Blog and me

When I was in primary school, my father posted my diaries I wrote onto a "sina blog". He would correct my grammar mistakes and add something that he thought would make them not too childish. And it indeed attracted many of my friends and even people from Hong Kong to comment below my posts. This is probably why I like to record things in my life. When I was in bachelor's, I also have a [jianshu blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/18555ce3568e).
