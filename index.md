# Introduction

I am currently a 1st year Master Animal Sciences student in Wageningen University & research. Before coming to the NL, I spent for 4 years in Huazhong Agricultural University, and completed a bioinformatics bachelor's degree.

I am a solitary person, and I really enjoyed asking questions about why things are in the way they are. I like to use Unix tools, exploring bioinformtics algorithms, data visualization, genetics, history, etc.

When I was in primary school, my father asked me to open a blog, and posting the diary I wrote. This is probably why I like to record things in my life. I also have a [jianshu blog](https://www.jianshu.com/p/18555ce3568e).

I recently started to understand how computers have changed our world and because I now have my own room which is totally different from shared room during bachelor's, I spent quite some time thinking about who I am what I can do in my life. So I will post something into this new blog.
